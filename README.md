Known Bugs:

1. Draws cause an error. // Maybe not anymore.
2. No delay between user selection and computer play.
3. If player wins, computer will still play and can cause another "computer wins" alert.
4. Can't replay yet.
5. Scoring system doesn't work.
6. Pretty much impossible to lose.
7. Repeatedly clicking on a space already taken triggers computer to play again.
    - this could be resolved by calling the computer to play after my click on a relevant grid square rather than anywhere on board
.



Upcoming features:
1. Rather than computing a random position to select, the computer should play more strategically. e.g looking for lines with two 'O's to win, or looking for two lines with two 'X's to block the player.
