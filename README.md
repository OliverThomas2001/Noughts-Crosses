Known Bugs:

1. No delay between user selection and computer play.
2. Can't replay yet.
3. Scoring system doesn't work.
4. Pretty much impossible to lose.
5. Draws don't finish game.



Upcoming features:
1. Rather than computing a random position to select, the computer should play more strategically. e.g looking for lines with two 'O's to win, or looking for two lines with two 'X's to block the player.
